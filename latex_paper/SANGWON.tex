\section{Introduction}
In Korea, there’s a fashioned sentence “The general publics are dog and pig”. This sentence was just a script of Korean movie, “Insiders”, but it gives sympathies to many citizens. Our team started to think about why this sentence is caught in the minds of the people.

The articles of Korean presses tend to be writed on suggestive, prejudiced by inclination of that press rather than political facts, while editing politician’s opinions or moves. Also, the presses tend to report only in just portion of facts, only in favor of certain political orientations. Consequently the public can’t decide whether that article is neutral or biased on amicable organizations. So they tend to be instigated by that biased report quite often unknowing the facts. In fact, when looking at Naver(the largest portal site of Korea)’s political news article, a lot of people are instigated, unilaterally and aggressively commenting on the contents due to stimulating titles or contents that mixed with specific utterances and reporters' opinions. So Naver often hides highest recommended in such articles.

It means there is a lack of fact information that politic can’t judge politician objectively. Current articles are processed based on reporter’s political orientation, so people are more and more complicated, and can’t make decide based on their criteria. To escape on this situation, some people make an effort to access on assembly site to judge that certain politician’s utterances and their political orientation. But, finding information only on facts is not just easy. It brings about three problems below.

First, the most objective way to determine what a politician has spoken is to hear and judge pure speech of politician, not someone else’s refined words. Usually, the politician speaks something that is full of political beliefs in the political meeting. It would be a fact information that politic can determine about the politician. The public fact data of the politician in the internet are just only on election records, award records, criminal facts, etc. These simple examples don’t provide inclination of the politician. Hence, our team got conviction that the real opinion of politician is in the congressional records. Therefore, our team will develop a service that can verify what politician has spoken by serving  assembly minutes easily.

Second, the way to find congressional records is too complex. Congressional records in the assembly are typed by stenographer, and opened to the public through National Assembly Minutes. Public should link in National Assembly Minutes System and download pdf files to find remarks. Many citizens don’t interested in politics because it doesn’t give any monetary benefits or it doesn’t give fun to them. To turn their minds, minimized way to get information of politicians is needed. The National Assembly Minutes that doesn’t provide convenience to the citizen is just a nominal system. So our team decide to give information about Assembly minutes to citizen easily through web page. Also, we would like to use AI speaker to fulfill desires of various people.

Furthermore, the current minutes is not classified of its contents and politicians. The file name of minutes just designates on conference date and order. If the user wants to find specific agenda, they need to search it manually by scrolling the pdf files. So our team decide to give solution of this problem. We are going to parse all of the minutes and after classify the politician’s agenda and speech in the minutes. Also, we will make keyword searching system. This service will provide an useful function that search specific agenda and politician to users. It will be applied to AI speaker to make our service more useful.

The AI speaker(Smart speaker) is a kind of wireless speaker, which is activated by more than one impressive words(hot words). Voice-Command-Device wh ch embed The Virtual Assistant carries out co-interactive functions and hands-free commands.

The biggest difference between AI Speaker and typical Speaker is that the AI speaker recognizes “Speech Recognition” to perform specific commands like listening to music, setting alarm and timer, searching information like News, weather, etc. The main input and output unit of Speech-Recognition device is built-in Microphone and Speaker. The AI speaker is consisted of such like these simple units, so it is efficient to send and receive information than any other smartphone, smart TV.

Accordingly, the biggest advantage of using AI speaker is to order AI something by “Speak some words” when the user is doing some other things on their own hands or can’t type some words through smart device. For example, when the user is on the verge of falling asleep or busy for ready to go out, the user can’t afford to use a smart device. In addition, the old age people cannot afford to read long texts like minutes. So service is suitable for this people.

Specifically, The NUGU speaker is the first Korean-made AI speaker made by SKT in 2016. Over the last two years, The NUGU speaker so far developed a lot so typical functions such as mentioned above are already applied. So our team had to decide to make service that speaker doesn’t provide and groundbreaking service

Third, There is no current services that gather personalized inclined politician or his related field. By lacking of information of politicians, just some specific politicians are reminded to citizens. Though, even if the politician is not popular, some people’s area of interest can be similar to him. Maybe they want to subscribe regularly of that politician.When they want to find information of him, but they will find out that there are only refined, edited version of his mentions. So, based on whole minutes of specific politician’s participated, we will make a interested aria or keyword extraction service through big data analysis. This will be a good method to listen on politician who is similar to user’s interested area by setting up user’s keyword of interested area and scrapping of his activation.

In conclusion, we want to make a  personalized subscribe system of interested politician so the politic can determine of the politician based on objective facts. For this, our team will make service that meet four functions. first, recognizing specific politician’s statements by looking up assembly minutes. second, printing the words through web service and AI speaker. third, the function that finding agenda or politician easily. fourth, a method to listen on politician who is similar to user’s interested area by setting up user’s keyword of interested area and scrapping of his activation. Through this service, It is anticipated that the public’s independence and judgement will be improved.

\section{Related Works}
We have researched for softwares that are doing similar works or having similar logics to ours. There are some tools that are providing similar service with different logics, in different platform about politic software. By doing this research, we found out that software about politics is widely used in various kinds of fields and it has a lot of potential powers.

The g0v is an open source, open government collaboration started by Chia-liang Kao, ipa, kirby and others in late 2012 in Taiwan. Originally driven by a bimonthly hackathon, the community has expanded to include different professional and non-information technology background members. a "forked" version of that agency with contributions by civic hackers. Continuing this inspiration from the software development world, the forked content can then be "merged" back into the government agency's website. g0v is a community that promotes the transparency of government information and is committed to developing information platforms and tools for citizens to participate in society. As of the beginning of 2014, there have been contributors across three continents, and the results have been released in a free software model that embraces knowledge sharing.

GovTrack.us is a website developed by then-student Joshua Tauberer. It is based in Washington, D.C., and was launched as a hobby. It enables its users to track the bills and members of the United States Congress. Users can add trackers to certain bills, thereby narrowing the scope of the information they receive. The website collects data on members of Congress, allowing users to check members' voting records and attendance relative to their peers. It propagates the ideology of increasing transparency in the government and building better communication between the general public and the government.

The Sunlight Foundation is an American 501 nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for open government. The organization was founded in April 2006 with the goal of increasing transparency and accountability in the United States Congress, the executive branch, and in state and local governments. The foundation's primary focus is the role of money in politics. The organization seeks to increase campaign finance regulations and disclosure requirements.The Sunlight Foundation advocates for more regulation and limitations regarding campaign finance. The organization opposed the ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, calling it "disastrous.". The organization supported the DISCLOSE Act, a congressional bill that would have enacted stricter campaign finance regulations by requiring increased disclosure of political spending in federal elections. The Sunlight Foundation believes that Congress should mandate real-time online disclosure of political contributions. It opposes dark money, or funds given to nonprofit organizations that are not required to disclose their donors.

Brigade Media, also known as Brigade, is a civic technology platform that was formed on June 4, 2014, and founded by James Windon, Jason Putorti, John Thrall, Matt Mahan, and Miche Capone. The platform is intended to serve as a way for users to connect with others who share the same or similar views and voice their opinions, create debates, or organize petitions. This process is intended to make the users' concerns more visible to and influential towards United States' policymakers. One mission of Brigade Media is to act as a foreground for its users to connect and organize so that they can voice their opinions on our nation's issues. Another more general goal is to increase voter participation. Brigade interacts with American voters by linking its users to the same held concerns. The opinions of elected officials on those concerns will be provided and metrics about the candidate most similar in concerns and degree of concern will be available. This data should be useful for both candidates and voters, in that voters can voice their grievances and candidates must respond accordingly.

\section{Development Environment}
\subsection{Choice of development platform}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  \textit{Used platform and why}
	
We will going to use Linux OS platform, specifically Ubuntu ver 16.04 LTS.  (Ubuntu is free, completely customizable, resource-friendly than Windows platform.) Furthermore, Linux command line is the biggest reason to use this platform. Its Bash(Shell) with a various command makes our development process easy.
In addition, our team going to use Amazon Web Service(AWS) to upload our service to cloud server. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a leading infrastructure cloud service that offers scalable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows clients to rent powerful virtual computers and run their own applications. To use this, we have to boot an Amazon Machine Image(AMI). AMI Ubuntu ver 16.04 LTS is provided by the AWS in free tier, so we decide to use. Continuity with local OS version with server OS version helps to develop without problems that occur due to OS differences.
\\
  
   \item \textit{Used Programming Language and why}
       \begin{enumerate}
    	\item \textit{Python 3.7}
\\The Python Package Index(PyPI) contains numerous third-party modules that make Python capable of interacting with most of the other languages and platforms. Python provides a large standard library which includes areas like internet protocols, string operations, web services tools and operating system interfaces. Many high use programming tasks have already been scripted into the standard library which reduces length of code to be written significantly.\\

        \item \textit{Java 1.8}
 \\When use spring, the Java language framework, it provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java based applications. Spring also enables the developer to create high performing, reusable, easily testable and loose coupling enterprise Java application. So to speak, Spring provides an abstraction layer on existing technologies like servlets, jsps, jdbc, jndi, rmi, jms and Java mail etc., to simplify the development process. Spring also provides a light-weight container which can be activated without using web server or application server.\\
    
            \item \textit{Javascript}
 \\Vue.js, a Javascript framework with various optional tools for building user interfaces, is  widely used across the world for web development. One of the greatest advantages of Vue.js is its small size. The size of this framework is 18–21KB and it takes not much time to download. Also, it is quite easy to understand. In simple web structure like our project software, Vue.js can be easily added. The documentation with Vue.js is so comprehensive so we can develop our service quickly and concretely.\\
    
            \item \textit{HTML5}
 \\ HTML is one of the best option to develop the webpage or website for the small or growing business that does not want to invest more in purchasing software or its license and does not require any advanced programming for their websites. HTML provides an easy way to optimize the website in HTML according to browsers to the web developers. HTML can be easily integrated with multiple languages and does not create any issues in it. The most important thing is HTML is used in frontend development for over so many years before we have no other languages available in the market for web development.\\

            \item \textit{CSS}
 \\ CSS allows for more control over the presentation of our web pages. The Style Sheets specification works by allowing to specify rules that say how the content of elements within our document should appear. One of its key benefits is the way it allows the separation of document content. Converting from an HTML page to a CSS design page may be a bit difficult and time consuming task. So, we decide to use CSS.\\
