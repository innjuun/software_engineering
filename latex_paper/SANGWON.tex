\section{Introduction}
In Korea, there’s a fashioned sentence “The general publics are dog and pig”. This sentence was just a script of Korean movie, “Insiders”, but it gives sympathies to many citizens. Our team started to think about why this sentence is caught in the minds of the people.

The articles of Korean presses tend to be writed on suggestive, prejudiced by inclination of that press rather than political facts, while editing politician’s opinions or moves. Also, the presses tend to report only in just portion of facts, only in favor of certain political orientations. Consequently the public can’t decide whether that article is neutral or biased on amicable organizations. So they tend to be instigated by that biased report quite often unknowing the facts. In fact, when looking at Naver(the largest portal site of Korea)’s political news article, a lot of people are instigated, unilaterally and aggressively commenting on the contents due to stimulating titles or contents that mixed with specific utterances and reporters' opinions. So Naver often hides highest recommended in such articles.

It means there is a lack of fact information that politic can’t judge politician objectively. Current articles are processed based on reporter’s political orientation, so people are more and more complicated, and can’t make decide based on their criteria. To escape on this situation, some people make an effort to access on assembly site to judge that certain politician’s utterances and their political orientation. But, finding information only on facts is not just easy. It brings about three problems below.

First, the most objective way to determine what a politician has spoken is to hear and judge pure speech of politician, not someone else’s refined words. Usually, the politician speaks something that is full of political beliefs in the political meeting. It would be a fact information that politic can determine about the politician. The public fact data of the politician in the internet are just only on election records, award records, criminal facts, etc. These simple examples don’t provide inclination of the politician. Hence, our team got conviction that the real opinion of politician is in the congressional records. Therefore, our team will develop a service that can verify what politician has spoken by serving  assembly minutes easily.

Second, the way to find congressional records is too complex. Congressional records in the assembly are typed by stenographer, and opened to the public through National Assembly Minutes. Public should link in National Assembly Minutes System and download pdf files to find remarks. Many citizens don’t interested in politics because it doesn’t give any monetary benefits or it doesn’t give fun to them. To turn their minds, minimized way to get information of politicians is needed. The National Assembly Minutes that doesn’t provide convenience to the citizen is just a nominal system. So our team decide to give information about Assembly minutes to citizen easily through web page. Also, we would like to use AI speaker to fulfill desires of various people.

Furthermore, the current minutes is not classified of its contents and politicians. The file name of minutes just designates on conference date and order. If the user wants to find specific agenda, they need to search it manually by scrolling the pdf files. So our team decide to give solution of this problem. We are going to parse all of the minutes and after classify the politician’s agenda and speech in the minutes. Also, we will make keyword searching system. This service will provide an useful function that search specific agenda and politician to users. It will be applied to AI speaker to make our service more useful.

The AI speaker(Smart speaker) is a kind of wireless speaker, which is activated by more than one impressive words(hot words). Voice-Command-Device wh ch embed The Virtual Assistant carries out co-interactive functions and hands-free commands.

The biggest difference between AI Speaker and typical Speaker is that the AI speaker recognizes “Speech Recognition” to perform specific commands like listening to music, setting alarm and timer, searching information like News, weather, etc. The main input and output unit of Speech-Recognition device is built-in Microphone and Speaker. The AI speaker is consisted of such like these simple units, so it is efficient to send and receive information than any other smartphone, smart TV.
